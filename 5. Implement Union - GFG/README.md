# 5. Implement Union
## Easy
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><span style="font-size:18px">Unions can be useful in many situations where we want to use the same memory for two or more members.&nbsp;Now suppose we want to implement a binary tree data structure where each leaf node has a double data value, while each internal node has pointers to two children, but no data.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Your have&nbsp;to create Binary Tree&nbsp;<strong>struct node</strong>. In the Binary Tree&nbsp;you should have members with one as<strong> double data </strong>and the other as<strong> union </strong>containing left and right pointers.</span><span style="font-size:18px"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
You just have to create struct binary tree node&nbsp;wih required data members.</span></p>
